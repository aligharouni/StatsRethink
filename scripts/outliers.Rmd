Ben Bolker et al discussed topics like:

   robust estimation (M-estimation)
   what do 'outliers' in boxplots mean?
   leverage and influence
   'breakdown points' and contamination
   mixture models

   but the main point (I think) is to understand (1) what process you
think is generating outliers and (2) what effects you think the outliers
are having on the results

- use vilonplot rather than boxplot when you have lots of data.
- hexbinplot

ggplot, scale="count", from ?geom_boxplot: if "area" (default), all violins have the same area (before
trimming the tails). If "count", areas are scaled
proportionally to the number of observations. If "width", all
violins have the same maximum width. 

For robust linear models? package robustbase 
robust mix model
